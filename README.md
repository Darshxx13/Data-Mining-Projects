## Machine Learning & Data Science Projects
This repository is a comprehensive collection of machine learning and data science projects I completed as part of my coursework and independent practice. It covers a wide range of techniques – from regression and classification to clustering, dimensionality reduction, and even an interactive Dash app.
The repo combines multiple batches of work into one unified portfolio, demonstrating my ability to explore datasets, apply statistical and machine learning models, and present results effectively.
